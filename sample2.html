    <p><h6>Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a storm surge from a tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal areas.

     <p>On November 29, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) identified a well-marked low pressure area in the southwest Bay of Bengal. It was expected to become a depression by November 30, a deep depression on December 2, and eventually a cyclonic storm by December 3. Thereafter, the IMD forecast that the system would move north towards coastal Andhra Pradesh, bringing rain and strong winds to areas in north Tamil Nadu on December 3 and 4, while travelling parallel to the latterâ€™s coast. It was finally expected to cross over land between Nellore and Machilipatnam as a cyclonic storm, with 80-90 km/hr winds gusting to 100 km/hr.</p>
